# Async, Promises and File System

## Async
- Code which runs in the background while the application keeps going
- Often called non-blocking 

## Promises
- Something that will at some point in the future resolve (have) a value.
- Can also reject when they can't get the value.

## File System (fs)
- Storage (cheap, big, slow, long term) vs Memory (expensive, small, fast, short term)
- fs library lets us read and write to storage
