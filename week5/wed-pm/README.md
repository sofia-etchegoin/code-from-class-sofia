# Consuming Web API Endpoints & useEffect

## Game Plan

- Fetching from an endpoint (Pok√©mon)
- Fetching from secured APIs (TMDB)
- Using a proxy server
- CORS and effect (Affirmations) (SOP, CORS)

## The Gist

- When you encounter a CORS error from an external API, 
  you can use your own server as a proxy
- When fetching from a secured API, you should
  store the API key on the server, using it as a proxy
- Fetch 'em all!
